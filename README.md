## Summary of the MOSS-I project
Summary here

## Repository organisation 
### Documents and outputs 
This repository contains the main source for the **Framework for Managing University Open Source Software** document in the form of a markdown document in the main folder called `document.md` (to learn more about markdown, see [this "cheatsheet"](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)).  Using the processes detailed below this markdown file is converted to a PDF file called [`document.pdf`](https://github.com/SFI-Lero/MOSS-I/tree/main/output/document.pdf) contained in the [`output`](https://github.com/SFI-Lero/MOSS-I/tree/main/output) folder.

### Template 
The PDF document produced here is generated from the markdown using a custom version of the [Eisvogel template](https://github.com/Wandmalfarbe/pandoc-latex-template). The main changes implemented here are the rendering of authors and DOI links. The template used here can be found under `/assets/templates` folder and is called [eisvogel.tex](https://github.com/SFI-Lero/MOSS-I/tree/main/assets/templates/eisvogel.tex). 

### GitHub action 
The GitHub is defined by a YAML file (see below) found in the `.github/workflows` folder. The action (to convert the markdown document to a pdf file) is triggered uppon a push to the repository. 

## Locally processing the markdown to PDF conversion
Assuming [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) is installed you can run the following locally (from a terminal navigated to the main project folder) to build the PDF:
```
pandoc document.md --output=output/document.pdf --template assets/templates/eisvogel.tex --listings --number-sections --bibliography=bibliography.bib --citeproc 
```

## GitHub action based markdown to PDF conversion
The below reproduces a so called [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) file which configures a GitHub action to trigger the updating of the repository hosted PDF when a _push_ occurs. Here the YAML file is called `markdown2pdf.yml` and is found in the [`.github/workflows`](https://github.com/SFI-Lero/MOSS-I/tree/main/.github/workflows) folder. Glossing over the YAML file one may see it sets up pandoc, issues a command using pandoc to export the `document.md` file to a file called `document.pdf` using the template called `eisvogel.tex`. Once completed the next step configures git and adds and commits the updated PDF file. Finally the PDF is pushes to the repository.
